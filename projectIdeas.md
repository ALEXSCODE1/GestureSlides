# Camera Vision Project Ideas

- **Slideshow Controller:** Advance, reverse, or pause a presentation using hand gestures.
- **Flashcard Digitalizer:** Detect physical flashcards and display/track them digitally.
- **Raised Hand Detector for Classrooms:** Notify teachers when a student raises their hand (remote or in-person learning).

- **Touchless Computer Control:** Use gestures to open tabs, close windows, or even shut down/restart your computer.
- **Form Feedback for Exercise:** Capture workout video and provide real-time or post-session posture/form guidance.

## Accessibility & Interaction
1. **Sign Language Recognition:** Detect and translate sign language gestures to text or speech for hearing people; support communication for deaf/hard-of-hearing users.
2. **Touchless UI Navigation:** Navigate an OS or application without a mouse/keyboard using tracked hand poses.
3. **Gesture-Controlled Game:** Build a simple game (e.g., whack-a-mole, rhythm, or reaction game) where in-air gestures trigger in-game actions.

# Project Plan

## 1. Review Winner Videos & Make a Plan
- **Objective**: Understand what makes past winning videos effective.
- **Deliverable**: Outline video structure (length, scenes, pacing).
- **Video Structure Draft**:
  - **Introduction** (10 seconds): Quick hook to engage viewer
  - **Problem Statement** (10 seconds): Clearly state the issue
  - **Solution/Features**: Show the product in action, benefits
  - **Impact**: Why it matters, how it helps
  - **Call to Action / Conclusion**: End strong with takeaway message

## 2. Script by Scene (Andy)
- **Each Scene Should Include**:
  - **Who is speaking?**
  - **What are they saying?**
  - **Visual elements (b-roll, slides, product, etc.)**

## 3. Programming (Mike, Alex)
- **Objective**: Enable slide interaction within the demo video
- **Tasks**:
  - Design & implement interactive slides
  - Ensure smooth transitions and responsiveness
  - Demo integration into final video

## 4. GitHub + Video Production Resources (Alex)
- **GitHub Tasks**:
  - Upload project files (code, media, etc.)
  - Organize with clear README (setup, usage)
- **Video Resources**:
  - Add documentation or links on:
    - How to record/edit video
    - Tips for making a compelling technical video
    - Recommended tools (OBS, DaVinci Resolve, etc.)
