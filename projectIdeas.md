## Accessibility & Interaction
1. **Sign Language Recognition:** Detect and translate sign language gestures to text or speech for hearing people; support communication for deaf/hard-of-hearing users.
2. **Touchless UI Navigation:** Navigate an OS or application without a mouse/keyboard using tracked hand poses.
3. **Gesture-Controlled Game:** Build a simple game (e.g., whack-a-mole, rhythm, or reaction game) where in-air gestures trigger in-game actions.
